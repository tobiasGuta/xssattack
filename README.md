# xssattack

This Python tool is designed to test web applications for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into specified URL parameters and detecting JavaScript alerts. It leverages the Selenium library for browser automation, uses webdriver-manager for ChromeDriver management, and supports concurrent execution for efficiency. Results are compiled into an HTML report and automatically opened in (linux)Firefox

This is how it looks in the report[.]html file.

This is how it look in the Terminal.

Note: If you have a custom payload, you can use it here.

# Features

Automated XSS Testing: Automatically injects payloads into specified URL parameters and checks for JavaScript alerts.
Headless Browser Execution: Uses a headless Chrome browser for testing, which allows for running tests without a visible UI.
Concurrent Execution: Tests are performed in parallel using Pythonâ€™s concurrent.futures to speed up the process.
Custom Payloads: Supports custom payloads loaded from a file.
HTML Report Generation: Compiles the results into an HTML report with a styled table that lists payloads that triggered alerts.
Automatic Report Opening: The generated report is automatically opened in Firefox(linux) or google chrome(windows)for quick review.

# Reqiurements

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

The tool is executed from the command line with several arguments:

    python xss.py -u <URL> -p <PARAM> -f <PAYLOAD_FILE> [-n <NUMBER>] [-o <OUTPUT_FILE>]
Arguments:

    -u, --url (Required): The URL to test, ending with a parameter placeholder (e.g., http://example.com/page?param=).
    -p, --param (Required): The name of the parameter to inject payloads into (e.g., search).
    -f, --file (Required): Path to a file containing custom payloads (one per line).
    -n, --number (Optional): Number of random payloads to test. Defaults to 10.
    -o, --output (Optional): The name of the output HTML report file. Defaults to report.html.

Example

 Parameter-Based XSS Testing:
 
    python3 xss-param.py -u "http://example.com/search.php?q=space" -p "q" -f payloads.txt -n 5 -o xss_report.html

 Path-Based XSS Testing:
 
    python xss-param-and-path.py -u "http://example.com/search/" -f "payloads.txt" -n 10 -o "report.html" --path


Dependencies

    Selenium
    WebDriver Manager
    argparse
    urllib.parse
    concurrent.futures
    random
    html
    webbrowser
    os
    chromedriver
    google-chrome

Ensure you have these dependencies installed and configured for the tool to function correctly. The webdriver-manager library automatically handles ChromeDriver downloads and updates, so no manual setup is required.
Note

The script assumes that Firefox(linux) or google-chrome(windows)is installed at a default location on the system. Adjust the path to the Firefox executable if necessary for different environments.

I wanted to let you know that I'll be regularly updating the wordlist with new payloads I've discovered from various platforms, Please check back every Sunday for the latest updates!
